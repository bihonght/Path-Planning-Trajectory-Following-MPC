# Path-Planning-Trajectory-Following-MPC
Design an algorithm to control robot to follow any desired trajectory. The main method using is MPC

The project shows 3 common cases of this problem: 
  - point stabilization (trajectory complex.fig)
  - trajectory following without noise (80_without_noise.fig)
  - trajectory following with noise  (80_with_noise.fig)
